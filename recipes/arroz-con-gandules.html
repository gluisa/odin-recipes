<h3> Description</h3>
<p> 
    Arroz con Gandules are a typically Puerto-rican dish any puerto-rican will attest their grandmother makes the best.
    (I also make that affirmation!) 
</p>
<p>
    An aromatic dish with fragrant rice 
    and pigeon peas (less than desirably named but truly delicious) 
    will be sure to become a quick favorite of all who try it.
